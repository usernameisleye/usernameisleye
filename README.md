### Hi 👽, My name is [Leye](https://twitter.com/usernameisleye).
I am a Full Stack Developer...though I pay a little more attention to Front End haha. My goal as Full Stack Developer is to bring something fascinatedly new to the tech space.

I was most recently a Junior Full Stack Developer at [Catalyst Business Consult](https://catalystbusinessconsult.com/). 

### About Me?!
* I like watching Animes and reading Manga📚!
* I am currently learning PostgreSQL, React and SASS.
* I am currently looking for internships to 'up' my experience and skill as a Developer.

Fun fact about me is that I HATE when devices overcharge!

### Programming Languages and Frameworks I Like
Currently the programming languages and frameworks I take a lot of intrest in are;

* JavaScript & ReactJS
* Tailwind CSS Framework
* SASS etc
