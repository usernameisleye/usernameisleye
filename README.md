### Greetings 👽, My name is [Leye](https://twitter.com/usernameisleye).
I am a Full Stack Developer...though I pay a little more attention to Front End haha. My goal as Full Stack Developer is to bring something fascinatedly new to the tech space.

Fun fact about me is that I HATE when devices overcharge!
